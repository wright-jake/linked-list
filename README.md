# linked-list
A collection of all my data structures and algorithm solutions where linked lists have been used

For singly linked lists, every node contains a value and a reference field to link to the next node, we add and delete nodes by modifying the reference field

Most of the time we use pointers (not always two) to solve problems with linked lists

When we want to return a linked list we can usually do this by just calling the head

For doubly linked lists, every node contains a value and a reference field to link to the next node and the previous node, we add and delete nodes by modifying the reference field
